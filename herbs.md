**Rosemary, Thyme, Lavender, Marjoram and other Mediterranean Herbs:** These like dry and fairly warm conditions. Set them at or near the top of the herb spiral on the south facing side (north in the southern hemisphere). Rosemary and lavender should be top centre of your herb spiral because of their deep roots.

**Sage, Oregano:** These herbs are amongst those that also thrive in dry conditions but benefit from the shade of plants above them on the herb spiral.

**Coriander, Dill, Basil:** These plants like more moisture than the above and yet still benefit from being in full sun, (at least in cooler climates) so should be placed lower but on the sunnier side of the spiral.

**Parsley, Mint, Chives:** These plants and others will enjoy shadier and moister conditions on the cooler side of your herb spiral near the bottom.
