"I have two 2-compartment tumbler composters, and I am getting a batch of finished compost every week. One of the main ingredients that I add which creates lots of heat is free coffee grounds from the local coffee shops. I also get vegetable/fruit pulp from a local juice bar. It takes me a week to fill one of the 4 compartments, and that one is full the first one that was filled 4 weeks earlier is ready to dump out. That empty compartment then starts getting filled as the other 3 are working to make compost. Since I don’t have enough “brown” material for all of that compost, I use the compressed pine pellets which I buy from the farm store in 40 pound bags – the pine pellets are made for horse bedding or cat litter boxes, but they are excellent for composting, too!"
