 * "This bench idea is one that incorporates logs into the design. The legs of the bench are evenly cut logs, while the seating is made from smoothed out wood that is stained to add beauty to the wood. The ferns and plants near the bench add a woodsy feel to the sitting area."

 * "This next bench design is one that is designed to provide you with a large sitting area that is perfect for entertaining guests. The bench is designed with a box-like style that also doubles as a storage space where you can conveniently keep your outdoor equipment or your childrenâ€™s toys."
