"But even with a dedicated patch, it is worthwhile incorporating companion plants to keep your strawberries growing strong. Herbs such as mint, chives, sage, caraway and thyme, and flowers like borage can all be excellent options, for example."

"A raised bed or in ground growing area containing asparagus can be a good spot for strawberries too. They like similar conditions and can be grown alongside one another without competing for nutrients.

In a perennial polyculture bed containing strawberries and asparagus, you can also include other perennial plants, including the aromatic herbs mentioned above, and perennial plants in the allium (onion) family. You could also include plenty of perennial flowering plants, to bring in those pollinators and other beneficial insects."
